## Project Description 📜

The **To-Do Application** is a simple web-based tool designed to help users organize and manage their daily tasks. Users can add, edit, and delete tasks. It allows for efficient task management with a **check all** button that lets users mark all tasks as done or undone. It also features a **falling effect** when a task is deleted and a **confirm pop-up** for task deletion.

### Key Features:

- Users can **add** tasks with titles.
- **Edit** existing tasks to modify their titles.
- **Delete** tasks with a confirm prompt to prevent accidental removal.
- Users can **mark all tasks as done** or **uncheck all tasks** with a "Check All" button.
- The application provides a **falling effect** when a task is deleted, enhancing the UI experience.
- Tasks are saved in the browser’s **local storage**, so tasks persist even after refreshing the page.
- Tasks that are marked as **done** are visually distinguished with a different style.
